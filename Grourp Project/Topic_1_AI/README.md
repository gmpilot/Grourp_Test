## 🌟 Featured Code Snippet

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load dataset
data = ...

# Split into training and testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data["features"], data["labels"], test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Test model
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```
